Syntax of my own version of DeadFish:

i Increment the accumulator by 1
d Decrement the accumulator by 1
s Multiply the accumulator by itself
o Display the accumulator as integer
รถ Display the accumulator as integer without newline
h Halt
x Quit shell
I Begin statement def
D Set accumulator to 0
S End statement def
O Display accumulator as Unicode character
ร Display accumulator as Unicode character without newline
H Define statement name
? Print statement name
! Print statement function
Statement definitions:
    I Hv ii S vvv o h
    Here, a statement's defined with I.
    Its name is selected "v" using the H operator.
    Its role is "ii", meaning it increments the accumulator by 2.
    Its definition is finished with S.
    It's used 3 times as "vvv".
    So when printed with o, it'll output "6" (3*2).
    Then, program's halted with "h".
WARNING: Statements can't be nested in this IDE.
