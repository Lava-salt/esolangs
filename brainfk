I made my modified version of BrainF**k esolang.
+ Increment the value of the current cell
- Decrement the value of the current cell
> Move pointer to the right
< Move pointer to the left
. Print the Unicode character of the current cell
, Take user input (store in the current cell)
[ Jump past matching } if the current cell is 0
] Jump back to matching { if the current cell is not 0
; Print the raw value of the current cell (instead of Unicode)
# Set the current cell to zero
@ Duplicate the value of the current cell to the next cell
& Swap the current cell with the previous cell
% Multiply the current cell by 2
$ Divide the current cell by 2 (integer division)
^ Move the pointer to the first nonzero cell
~ Move the pointer to the last nonzero cell
( Push the current cellâ€™s value onto a stack
) Pop the last value from the stack into the current cell
