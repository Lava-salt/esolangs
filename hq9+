I made my Turing Complete modified version of HQ9+ esolang.
C Copies input to output.
H Prints "Hello, world!"
I Interprets input as program source.
Q Prints the program source code.
R Encrypts input with ROT-13.
S Sorts input lines randomly given from 1 to 10.
9 Prints the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
+ Increments the accumulator.
- Decrements the accumulator.
* Doubles the accumulator.
/ Divides the accumulator by 3.
% Modulos the accumulator by n%2.
x Redefines the accumulator to its square.
X Redefines the accumulator to its cube.
& The / operation but int instead of float
A Print the accumulator
F Prints FizzBuzz up to 100.
- Dereferences a null pointer if preceded by an F.
$ Push the accumulator to the stack
# Pop a value from the stack and print it
^ Pop a value from the stack and print its ASCII value
= Print new line (\n in C++)
/ Get input from user and turn accumulator to it
P Get input from user and push string to stack
> Pop a value from the stack execute it in Python
< Pop a value from the stack evaluate it in Python
½ Pop a value from the stack and execute it in Batch
\ Get input from user and turn accumulator to its Unicode value
@ Repeat code after this 2 times.
€ Repeat code after this 3 times.
é Repeat code after this infinitely.
0 Turns accumulator to binary
2 Prints 2 and 3 timetable (used for looping and multiplying/dividing in HQ9+)
G LGBTQ+ approved HQ9+ H
: Push accumulator's Unicode value to stack
; Append accumulator's Unicode value to stack's top value
